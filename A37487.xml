         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe enſuing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories were writ by a Worthy and Learned Pen, at the Request of ſome Gentlemen and Ladies, and now Publiſh'd from his own Manuſcript, that the more Ingenious Part of the World may ſhare in that Recreation, which was at firſt deſign'd for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Entertainment of ſome Perſons of Honour. The Stories are here told under feigned Names, that we might preſerve that Reſpect and Reverence due to their Title and Grandeur.</p>

When the News was Spread, the Noble <hi>Melintus</hi> was withdrawn, it Raiſ'd a Wonder in all; His own Merits having Gain'd him more then Ordinary favour from his Prince, and his Courtly preſence, and Obliging Mean, Won a reſpect from all that knew him.

               <byline>By GERONTO.</byline>
               <p>A Gentleman, younger Brother of a very good Family in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the advantage of a Liberal Education at the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> left thoſe happy Walls, eſteeming that ſort of Collegiate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment too narrow for his more aſpiring and ambitious Thoughts, which now began to feel the heats of Love, and Warmer deſires of attaining that pitch of Honour and Reputation his Anceſtors had Arrived to. Having thus taken leave of his Studies, he return'd into the Countrey to receive the plentiful proviſion his Father had by Will aſſgned him, which amounted to 4000 li. on which foundation (tho' Inconſiderable to what his elder Brother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd) he doubted not to raiſe as Subſtantial a fortune by his Induſtrious Improvement as his Birth-right had deny'd him: With this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowing the Barren Soyl of a Countrey
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51968:6"/>Life, was not ſo fit to accompliſh his deſigns as the more fruitful emploiments that attended a Court and City, he repaired to <hi>London:</hi> But bringing with him a Temper too Generous to Flatter, and too Gentile to Cozen, he quickly found without the firſt he muſt expect no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment at Court, and wanting the Second it was Impoſſible to advantage himſelf am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dſt a Crowd, whoſe only patrimony was their craft. In the midſt of theſe Thoughts he had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to return to the more innocent diverſions of the Countrey; But finding himſelf intangled in his Affairs, and engaged in the acquaintance of the Town Gallants, who at firſt had inſenſibly wrought him into their Society, by thoſe N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts and Subtletys they Spread to catch the heedleſs and Unwary; And being ſoftned by the charms and allurements of the fairer Sex, to whoſe Viſits he was every day enticed, he found it impoſſible to diſcharge himſelf of theſe Inconveniences, tho' he had before his Eyes the moſt diſmal proſpect of miſery, and inevitable Ruine of his Fortunes which now began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume apace, and in three years time the whole Treaſure was quite Exhauſted. His Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had ſo often been reliev'd by his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kindneſs were ſo far from pitying or Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in theſe diſtreſſes, that like the Summer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51968:6"/>Birds, they left his Winter'd Quarters to ſeek a Spring in ſome warmer Climate, without the leaſt Gratitude or kind remembrance of thoſe Laviſh kindneſſes with which they had been ſo often refreſh'd? In this Condition, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the uſual Comerade of diſtreſs, preſented her wrinkled Face to the poor undone Youth, and brought into his Thoughts his former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriges, but with all leſt him deſtitut of any obliging Clue to Extricate himſelf from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth his follies and Misfortunes had Inſnar'd him in. How ready he then was to curſe the Influence of thoſe Starrs that frown'd at his Birth, and Raiſ'd in his own Breaſt an Enemy againſt himſelf; To blame his paſt Improvidence, and all the Obliquityes of his former Conduct; They can beſt Judge who have ſeen and known how few Friends adverſity affords, and how the pleaſures of former proſperity are the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ingredients of preſent Calamity.</p>
               <p>In this deplorable Eſtate after that by renew'd ſollicitations he had wearied all his Friends, Poverty began to grow Shamefull, his wonted Embroider yes were now worn into Rags, the Treats and Regalios' with which he had tired out the day, and Stole from the Hours of Reſt to Solace himſelf with, now Tantaliz'd his preſent Hunger; His Beds of Down and ſofter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51968:7"/>Companions of Nightly Amours, were now no more, a Numerous concourſe of Dunns with their Loud Alarms broke his Reſt, and like Hornets with their Stinging Demands, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tormented him, and he who but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Court and admiration of every Flattering Sycophant, is now their Scorn and Laughter. Inſtead of his Livery'd Attendants, the Staff Officers watch his Steps, and nothing but the infamy of a Priſon and the Gripes of penury, are the thoughts with which he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains himſelf; So that being forc'd to the utmoſt Extremity, he reſolv'd rather with the Prodigal, to return to his Fathers Houſe, than feed upon Husks amongſt the <hi>London</hi> Swine; To which End, having Raiſ'd as much Money as the remains of his Moveables would pledge for, he began his Journey for the Weſt, hoping his Friends would Commiſerate his indigent Condition, however one Bleſſing he was ſure of, to be out of the Noiſe and Clamour of his Ravenous Creditours. His Money being ſhort he was forc'd to Travel on Foot, nor had he hopes it could carry him to his Journey End, but reſolving to truſt his better fortune he ſet for ward; And having Travelled three dayes ſaw the laſt penny diſpoſed of. The Evening now drew on apace, and he found himſelf Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly

This Gentleman who was of conſiderable Eſtate and quality, had great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Company to his Houſe, with whom <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſoon acquainted himſelf, his Generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and affable Temper rendred him Courted and belov'd by all: He was likewiſe the Happy Father of three Daughters of ſo Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Beauty that the whole Countrey could not produce their equals, nor were they leſs praiſ'd for a prudent Conduct, and Vertuous Education.

               <p>With theſe and ſuch like Courtly Expreſſions as opportunity would give leave, did our Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd Pair paſs away the Hours, and give each other the aſſurance of as ſtrong and laſting an Affection as Love it ſelf could implant in the minds of the moſt paſſionate; Nor was the ſame ſo ſecretly caution'd, but that the Parents of <hi>Ortelia</hi> took Notice of its Growth, which as they ſaw no reaſon to diſcourage, ſo neither would they give Licenſe to the continuance of it, till ſuch time as <hi>Amaſius</hi> his Father was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, and they had obtain'd his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. To which purpoſe the Dutch Merchant diſcourſ'd <hi>Amaſius,</hi> telling him, that he was on his part ready to give <hi>Ortelia</hi> a proportionable fortune to what his Father ſhould ſettle on him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51968:18"/>and was no wayes averſe to his Marriage with his Daughter. <hi>Amaſius</hi> with tears of Joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his acknowledgements, and Entreated him by all the Endearments Imaginable, by the next Pacquet to acquaint his Father with it, and beg his leave that it might be forthwith Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, this he promifed, and accordingly did; This Letter <hi>Amaſius,</hi> Seconded with one of his own, wherein he deſcribed the Vertues and agreeable ſweetneſs of <hi>Ortelia</hi>'s temper, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon that without his leave his thoughts had been fixt upon her, which he believ'd were directed by the Hand of providence, and deſign'd by Heaven for the Eſtabliſhment of his future happineſs. The Father was well pleaſed with the propoſals made by his Correſpondent, and in a ſhort time after return'd his conſent. This was certainly welcom'd with no inconſiderable Joy by the Lovers, who had Spent the laſt month in fear that ſome croſs accident might Obviate their expectations, or at leaſt procraſtinate their Nuptials, which they ſo earneſtly wiſhed for, But having now the Conſent of their Parents Concurrent with their own deſires, the day of Marriage was agreed upon to be within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and all neceſſary preparations taken care of, to render it as Splendid as publick. The pulſes of our Lovers be at nothing but deſire, and

His Father was immediately acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, who coming to his Bed ſide found him extreamly ill, and fitter for the Advice of the Phyſitians then the Entertainment of his Friends, or the intended Solemnity.

Accordingly one Evening he took an opportunity to diſcloſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telia</hi>'s Death to him omiting thoſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that more particularly concern'd her love to him, which would rather aggravate then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay his paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas Sir! ſaid</hi> Amaſius, <hi>I have long ſince known more of that affair then you are pleaſ'd to Communicate to me now; I know that</hi> Ortelia <hi>is dead, and that</hi> Amaſius <hi>can never be happy till he is ſo too; But for this I muſt blame the weakneſs of my Love, that what a Woman could do for me, I cannot for her, nor dare not, Since I am forbid all violent Remedies, which adds to my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prevents that Cure, which otherwiſe I would ſoon accompliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Father was ſtrangely Surpriz'd to ſee himſelf prevented in his diſcovery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Amaſius</hi> to tell him how he came by his Intelligence, ſuppoſing that contrary to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51968:28"/>ſome of his Friends had acquainted him with it.</p>
               <p>Amaſius <hi>humbly beg'd his Pardon, and aſſur'd him, it was not from his Relations or any Perſon elſe he had Entruſted with the Secret, that he came by the knowledge of it, and earneſtly pray'd him not to preſs that queſtion any farther, which if in Obedience to his Commands he ſhould be oblig'd to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, would yet add more to that weight of ſorrow he ſo miſerably labour'd under.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Some time after his Father by the Advice of his Friends, remov'd <hi>Amaſius</hi> into the Countrey, and having ſeveral Relations and acquaintance near <hi>York,</hi> that place was fixt upon, hoping that Change of Air and variety of Company might be of advantage to his Health, and a diverſion to his Melancholy. But Alas! He never En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a Minute free from the thoughts of his fair deceaſ'd <hi>Ortelia,</hi> the only Intervals of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he had, were when the kind Ghoſt of <hi>Orte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telia</hi> came to viſit him, which ſhe was often wont to do, or at leaſt his deluded Fancy Imagined ſo, from that time (when by the Severity of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was forc't to diſcover that he had both ſeen and diſcourſed with her the Night before the intended Marriage.) At ſeveral times would he ſtart upon a ſudden from his Company, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do you not hear <hi>Ortelia</hi>'s voice? I come, I come, my Dear, Ah there ſhe is, pray do but obſerve how kindly the poor <hi>Ortelia</hi> looks on her <hi>Amaſius,</hi> ſee how Melancholy and pale ſhe is, how beautifully ſorrowful ſhe Glances at me, Oh my Dear I come, but when ſhall I come, never
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51968:29"/>to part from thee more? Oh that this was that bleſſed Hour that would make me for ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with thee! And then retireing into the next Room, would talk with the ſame paſſionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Love and tenderneſs to her, as if he did really Converſc with her in the viſible form of Fleſh and Blood. Thus did he paſs away about half a year, when one Night after he had been walking and diſcourſing with her for at leaſt two Hour, (tho' at all theſe ſeveral times ſhe was never ſeen by any Perſon but himſelf, fometimes indeed they could diſtinguiſh two ſeveral Voices) when returning to his Friends more pleaſant and Merry then ever he had been before, I thank Heaven, ſayes he, my ſorrows have now found a period; I have but ſew nights more to repoſe on Earth, and then ſhall I live with my <hi>Ortelia,</hi> and enjoy Eternal Reſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Tranquillity of mind. That Night he Slept heartily and next Morning aroſe early in a moſt Serene and Compoſ'd Temper, at which his Friends were extreamly pleaſed, and tho' they were much Surpriz'd at the diſcourſe of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, yet ſeeing him continue ſo well for three dayes, they began to forget their fears, and pleaſe themſelves with the vain hopes of his perfect recovery. The next day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and Bowling-day, it was agreed they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51968:30"/>ſhould take their Horſes and Ride to the Green, and there Dine with other Gentlemen who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Met there once a Week: <hi>Amaſius</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented to it, which was the more taken Notice of, it being the firſt time they could ever prevail with him to go into a publick Company, or divert himſelf with any Sociable Recreation. After Dinner they Bowl'd again, when a diſpute ariſing about a Caſt, <hi>Amaſius</hi> took his friends part, at which his Adverſary was ſo Incenſed (being a Cholerick Perſon) that he ſtruck him with his fiſt, but the Gentlemen who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent interpoſeing they prevented any farther Miſcheif. <hi>Amaſius,</hi> who diſdain'd to receive ſo publick an Injury with the patience of a coward, withdrew into the Garden, and privately ſent a note to the Gentleman to let him know, he there expected with his Sword in his Hand Satifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Affront he had put upon him. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary came, and after ſome few paſſes ran <hi>Amaſius</hi> through the heart, of which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dyed, and went with Joy to meet his Dear <hi>Ortelia</hi> in the Shades below, to the great Grief of his Father and all his friends who had known his Vertuous and Honourable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</p>

               <p>IT was the unhappineſs of <hi>Cratander,</hi> whoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity very often out-ſtript his prudence, and his Natural Bounty the Narrow Confines
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51968:31"/>of his Eſtate, to be at laſt reduc'd to great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, his Friends Commiſerating his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adviſed how they might beſt aſſiſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſs and prevent his own and the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his family. They reſolv'd at laſt upon a friendly Contribution to raiſe ſome Moneys, and preſent him with a good Gelding, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd to him the going up to <hi>London,</hi> where he might put himſelf into ſome employ and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of the Kings Guards, which would afford him a Gentile and competent Support. <hi>Cratander</hi> was eaſily perſwaded to embrace the Councel of his friends, and not long after left the North his Native Countrey, and took his Journey to <hi>London.</hi> After he had ſpent ſome Months there in vain, either through his own ill Conduct, the Modeſty of his Temper which could not Sue for favours with that Confidence which others ſucceed by, or that his Stars had deſign'd him for ſome greater end, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Spent the little Stock he had, he ſaw he ſhould be ſoon forc't to Sell his Horſe to buy Hay, and to Live longer there at ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, would moſt certainly involve him in Debt and Miſery. In the midſt of theſe diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts he reſolved to quit the Town, and make a Viſit to an old Acquaintance who was Maſter of a plentifull Eſtate, and lived in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51968:31"/>Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> and accordingly did ſo. The next Morning he ſet out early, and Travell'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fifty Miles, when Night coming upon him haſtily he loſt his way upon a great Common, and not knowing the Coaſt of the Countrey wandred up and down, till at laſt he ſpy'd a Candle at a Shepherds Cott about half a Mile, diſtance, which he ſteer'd up to. Hallowing to know who liv'd there, the Shepherd came out, of whom he Enquired the way to the Town he intended to Lodge at that Night, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd told him he was five Miles off, and the way difficult to find, if he was a ſtranger in the Countrey, <hi>Cratander</hi> told him he was, and had already loſt his way and tired his Horſe, and If he would be ſo kind to give him Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for that night, he would gratifie him to his Content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Shepherd told him his was a Houſe but of one Room, tho' plentifully Furniſh'd with Inhabitants, that beſides his Wife and himſelf he had Six Children, and but one Bed, and a Matreſs, and not ſo much as a Hovell to put his Horſe in.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cratander</hi> then enquired if there was no neighbouring Village could give him a Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for one night, the Shepherd told him a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51968:32"/>mile off there was one, and if he pleaſ'd he would be his Guide, which <hi>Cratander</hi> accepted of when they were Arrived at it, they found but one Ale-houſe in the Town, and that afforded no better Accommodation then the Shepherds Hutt; <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tander</hi> in this diſtreſs, ask'd if there was no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or Farmer in the Town would be ſo kind to Entertain him for a Night, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd told him it was a very poor Village, but there was a Mannor Houſe in it, at which a Gentlewoman now liv'd who was Daughter to the Lord of the Mannor, who died ſix Months ago, that ſhe probably might be ſo kind to him as a ſtranger, when others for the ſame reaſon would diſtruſt and refuſe him ſo Charitable a favour. <hi>Cratander,</hi> with the directions of the Shepherd, went up to the Hall, the Shepherd knock'd at the gate, and told the ſervant a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman defir'd to ſpeak with her Miſtreſs, who immediately ſent to Invite him in, <hi>Cratander</hi> excuſ'd himſelf, that it would be too great a boldneſs in him who was a ſtranger to the Lady, but he would wait as a beggar at her Gate to intreat a Boon from her Hands.

               </p>
               <p>The Lady who was of a moſt affable and ſweet Temper told him readily he was moſt heartily Welcom, and ſhe only wiſh'd her preſent Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality could anſwer the Merits of her Gueſt; upon this invitation <hi>Cratander</hi> alighted, whom the Lady Conducted into the Houſe and order'd his Horſe to the Stable. He was Entertain'd in the principal Room with a plentiful Supper, which being ended, <hi>Cratander</hi> in the moſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Expreſſions paid his thanks to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Lady, and taking up his Sword and Piſtols which lay upon the Table, now Madam if you pleaſe, I will walk into the Stable and repoſe my felf by my Horſe, for this days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has made me both weary and Sleepy; The Lady at theſe words ſeem'd extreamly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and with a graceful ſharpneſs told him, She was very ſorry that the Cordial Welcom
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51968:33"/>She better deſign'd him, then was able to expreſs upon ſo ſudden an Occaſion ſhould be ſo far miſtaken; That ſhe hop'd her Houſe, how mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever Furniſh'd, might afford him a better Lodging then her Stable, which ſhe deſir'd he would believe by accepting of it. <hi>Cratander</hi> was much out of Countenance at this repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but recovering himſelf, Modeſtly reply'd, Dear Madam, you have already ſo infinitely oblig'd me that I had not Confidence enough to Treſpaſs farther upon ſo Generous a Temper, eſpecially when at the ſame time I conſider my ſelf an abſolute ſtranger to you, which perhaps may create ſome fears and Jealouſyes in your Family, though your Noble Breaſt which knows no Guilt in it ſelf, can Harbor no ſuſpition of others. The Lady Bluſht and told him, She ſaw too much Honour in his Perſon and demean to Judge ſo unworthily of him, and deſir'd he would pleaſe to take his Chair and paſs away half an Hour, till his Chamber was prepar'd for him. <hi>Cratander</hi> had obſerv'd that both before and at Supper the Maid that waited had her eye conſtantly fixt upon him, and with a look that ſpoke Horror and Conſternation, as if ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him for a Perſon who had ſome Villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous deſign brooding in his heart, which his being ſo well Arm'd gave occaſion for, Nor
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51968:33"/>was he miſtaken for ſhe had ſeveral times preſt her Miſtreſs that the ſtranger might lye in the Stable with his Horſe as he himſelf requeſted, That it happen'd out very odly that this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould come this very Night upon thoſe pretentions when no ſuch accident ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a Night when all the Men-Servants, had leave to be abroad at a Countrey Wake and none but Women and a poor Boy who belong'd to the Stables left at home, her Miſtreſs heard her reaſons and inclin'd to her Opinion, but conſidering what a reflection it would be upon her, if this ſtranger was really that worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he appear'd to be, ſhe reſolv'd to run all riſques rather then be guilty of ſo baſe and degenerous an Action. The Gentleman and Lady had paſs'd away the time in variety of diſcourſe, by which ſhe was now fixt in a good Opinion of him, and had fully baniſh'd thoſe fears and apprehenſions her Maid had whiſper'd in her Ear, when the Servant came down and told her the Chamber was ready, if the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pleaſ'd to go to Bed, upon which her Miſtreſs order'd her to take the Candle and wait upon him to his Lodging.

The Maid went to her Chamber, put out the Candle and lay'd herſelf upon the Bed, wiſhing for the Morning, which would diſpell thoſe Melancholy thoughts that now oppreſt her mind. Her preſent fears baniſh'd all Sleep from her Eyes, and the Clock had now ſtruck One, when ſhe heard a Noiſe in the Court-yard, ſtarting up ſhe ran to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where ſhe ſaw four Men at the door, who firſt Tryed the Latch to ſee if it was open, and finding it faſt Bolted and Lockt, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by main ſtrength to force their Entrance, the Maid frighted out of her wits, ran to her Miſtreſſe, Chamber, where with her paſſionate Out cryes, She awaken'd her, and told her,</p>

Il's convince you preſently,</hi> reply'd Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tander, <hi>and leaping out of Bed Slipt on his Clothes, and with his Sword and Piſtols, by the Maids direction, made to that part of the Houſe they firſt attempted,</hi> Cratander <hi>had the fortune to have juſt got to the door, when they forc't it open, and diſcharging one of his Piſtols amongſt them, he ſaw a Perſon drop, upon which they gave back; but he with his Sword in Hand, advanced two or three Steps, and by the oppoſition he met with, from one of them receiv'd a Slight Wound upon his Breaſt, which he reveng'd by another upon his Adverſaries right Arm, which ſo diſabled him that he gave back, and</hi> Cratander <hi>retreated to the door for fear their odds might oppreſs him, whoſe ſafety depended only on his ſingle Courage.

The Lady was very much Surpriz'd to hear of her Uncles ſo ſudden death, whom ſhe had not known to be ill, and particularly enquir'd the cauſe, to whom the Servant could give no other Anſwer, but that going to Bed ſomething indiſpoſ'd, he was found dead in the Morning, the Lady was now Furniſh'd with freſh occaſion of Grief, which ſhe made uſe of as a powerful reaſon to perſwade <hi>Cratander</hi> to ſtay one day longer, and particularly deſir'd him to bear her Company to that mournfull Solemnity. <hi>Cratander</hi> told her he was extreamly ſorry for her loſs of ſo near a Relation — Alas Sir, ſays ſhe, it is not that alone, I have a ſecond loſs in a good Friend, to whoſe Care and Advice my dying Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended me and I have been ſufficiently

Being arrived at the Houſe the Lady was earneſt to know what ſudden Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper was the cauſe of her Uncles death, her Aunt told her ſhe ſuppoſ'd an Apoplexy, but deſiring to ſee the Corps, ſhe anſwer'd that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Corpulent Fat Man the Coffin was nail'd up early in the Morning for fear the Body, which began already to Corrupt, ſhould be offenſive to the Company.

               <p>Madam, reply'd <hi>Cratander,</hi> I will proceed by ſuch wary Methods as you your ſelf ſhall approve of, I will go to ſome Chirurgion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and complain the wound I receiv'd on my Breaſt Feſters within, and adviſe with him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51968:38"/>for the Cure, and ſo from one to another; and if this Gentlemans wound appears to be ſo, and no ſtrain, in all probability he applyed himſelf to ſome Neighbouring Chirurgion, and by him may receive ſome leading Circumſtances to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or abate my Suſpition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, ſayes the Lady, upon the Terms I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, you may uſe your pleaſure. Cratander</hi> accordingly the next day took his Horſe, and at a publick Inn near the Town where the Uncle liv'd, deſir'd to know if there was ever a Chirurgion in that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whom he might ſafely intruſt. The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord directed him to one at the next Town, to whom <hi>Cratander</hi> Show'd his wound, which was not perfectly Cured, and in diſcourſe, was asking if he had much practice in the Country for green Wounds, the Chirurgion told him every tittle, and that by accident the other day, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been engag'd in a quarrel, receiv'd a Cut on his Right Hand, whom he now had under Cure, which had it not ſlanted a little had certainly Cut all his Muſcles in two and for ever diſabled him. The Perſon &amp; Circumſtance of time he more particularly urg'd, but at that diſtance, as if rather for diſcourſe ſake then Enquiry, and found them all Correſpond with his firſt Suſpition. At Night he acquainted the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51968:38"/>Lady with the particulars, and prevail'd with her, that he might get a Juſtice of Peaces War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to apprehend him, and oblige him upon his Examination to give a Satisfactory account where and when he receiv'd that wound. This was done and the Gentleman taken into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who giving only Evaſive Anſwers, was told if he would not be more poſitive and direct, they ſhould be forc'd to charge him more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally, which an ingenious Confeſſion might prevent or in ſome meaſure attone. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was in great confuſion what to ſay, but at laſt fully Confeſt the whole matter, that he with two more whom he Named, were won by the Uncle upon the promiſe of a Conſiderable reward to aſſiſt him in this Enterprize, that they pitch'd upon that Night rather then any other, becauſe the Men-Servants would be abroad, and the Houſe defenceleſs, that they had reſolv'd to Murther the Young Lady and all the Family, for fear they ſhould hereafter tell any Tales, that the Uncle was Shot at the door where he receiv'd his hurt by <hi>Cratander,</hi> and afterwards they came back and brought of his Body for fear of a diſcovery. Upon this the Gentleman was committed to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Gaol, the other Two having ſome Notice of it fled. The Body of the Uncle was taken up, and found to be Shot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51968:40"/>reſpect to his Perſon and quality) was the Eldeſt Son of a Worthy Gentleman in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and Heir to a fair Eſtate. His Father took parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care in his Education, to furniſh him with all the Accompliſhments Suitable to his parts and Character, for Nature had been prodigal to him in all the gifts of mind, which ſhe inchaſ'd in a Body of Elegant Compoſure and perfect Symmetry. After he was arriv'd to more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural years, his Father brought him up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and enter'd him into the Society of <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inn, where he not ſo much deſign'd him for a profound Lawyer, as to be Capable to ſerve his Country in that Station and Quality he was born in. For the firſt two years he was obſerv'd by all, for a Sedulous Student, and knew no other pleaſures or diverſions of the Town, then thoſe of the play-Houſe or Dancing-School, both which he rarely frequented, and then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Complaiſance to his Friends then Inclination in himſelf. It fortun'd one day he was Invited abroad by ſome of his acquaintance to an Entertainment of the Spring-Gardens, where they were Engag'd to Meet ſome Ladies, to whom the laſt Night they had loſt a Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at a Game at C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51968:40"/>Gentlemen and Ladies met accordingly, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was Noble and Coſtly, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Generous and Frank, and the Ladies fair and Obliging. <hi>Charilus</hi> whoſe heart was yet a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Love, began of a ſudden to feel its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer powers, and himſelf diſcompoſ'd that he reſolv'd all happineſs into that of Love, and Condemned the ignorance of his paſt Life, who had only Studyed Men and Books to know the worſt half of Mankind, and neglected the fairer Sex, the Beauty and Glory of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Having thus but dipt his Foot in the water he found it ſo refreſhing he reſolv'd to wade farther and plunge himſelf into that Abyſs of pleaſures his Thirſty Soul ſo eagerly Coveted. Theſe Ladies brought him into the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of others, which they inlarg'd to their own Friends, till in a ſhort time the day was not long enough for him to pay his Viſits (which he punctually obſerv'd) to each expecting Miſtreſs. About this time his Father dyed and left him a plentifull Eſtate with a conſiderable Sum of ready Money, which he improv'd to the better Conduct and more eaſy Management of his Amorous Intrigues, Numerous were the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Clients of this young Lawyer, and the rather becauſe he gave, but receiv'd no Fees, except thoſe in Tail, beſides the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51968:41"/>he had of other Gentlemen in his comely perſonage and courteous behaviour, that he wounded more hearts in a week then he could Cure in a Month with his beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.

But after ſeveral Viſits made with all paſſion and diligence as the Devil would have it, <hi>Bellinda</hi> prov'd of a different mould from other Ladies of her Sex, and Vertue had been Regent at her Nativity, above Beauty or pleaſure. <hi>Charilus</hi> who had never met a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe like this in the whole Career of his hot deſires; Intreated, Treated, preſented, which the Lady ſtill accepted upon honourable terms.

               <p>With theſe and other arguments and the moſt Solemn proteſtations his quick Invention, could Furniſh his Expreſſions with, he won the credulous <hi>Bellinda,</hi> who without any tedious or formal Ceremony of contract, took his word <hi>Charilus</hi> immediatly order'd private Lodgings for himſelf and <hi>Bellinda,</hi> where they liv'd with the higheſt content and Satisfaction, the ſix Months being expir'd, <hi>Bellinda</hi> remembred him of his promiſe; which he excuſed at that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51968:42"/>time, as a thing that might be done any day, for that he was engaged in ſome Affairs of great Importance. Thus from time to time he had alwayes ſome Studied Anſwer to divert the diſcourſe, which at laſt ſhe found had no place in his intentions, and preſt no farther. However no Perſons liv'd more amicably and Friendly together, that I much queſtion (were there not other more Subſtantial reaſons to be given) whether an indiſſolveable Tye of two Perſons, does not render their Converſe more uneaſy, and their whole Lives more querulous, then if it was only a Knot which each Perſon. might unlooſe at pleaſure. <hi>Charilas</hi> who was alwayes of a Generous and Noble Temper (nor was <hi>Bellinda</hi> parcemonious) having one day an Occaſion for two hundred pounds, began to conſider his preſent Circumſtances and inſpect his accompts for the laſt ſeven years, when firſt his Acquaintance commenc'd with <hi>Bellinda;</hi> He found his Eſtate much impair'd by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Tenants, his Rents fallen one third, and the Body of the Eſtate ſunk under a weighty Mortgage, which ſtill prey'd upon the Vitals, beſides ſeveral Debts abroad, which would grow Clamorous and diſreputable to him, and fifteen Hundred pounds, which he had receiv'd as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>'s Portion, was ſometime ſince ſpent and forgotten, the Unwelcome proſpect he now had

At laſt he reſolv'd to diſintangle himſelf from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Lands and Mortgages and part with all for a valuable conſideration in Mony over which he would keep a ſtrick Eye, This he reſolv'd and in part perform'd. He ſold the whole Eſtate paid all his Debts, preſerv'd his Reputation with the world, and had two Thouſand pounds Overplus, to lay the foundation of a New for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which he promil'd himſelf might be eaſily done. But being naturally averſe to buſineſs, &amp; unwilling to deſcend below his former Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, he ſo long defer'd it, that there was not Room left for that conſideration, and Calling <hi>Bellinda</hi> one Morning into his Cloſet he ſhew'd her a draught of his preſent Misfortunes and withall told her there was but Three hundred left of the laſt two Thouſand pounds, that tho' he never was Ceremoniouſly Married to her, yet he look'd upon himſelf as oblig'd to provide for her; and not for that reſpect only, but as he ever had a moſt Sincere Love for her and that whatever diſtreſſe; ſhould befall him,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51968:43"/>her Share ſhould be the leaſt in them. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Lament her great Unhappineſs, who muſt ſhortly be Expoſ'd to the Injuryes of the World, and theinclemency of Friends, when <hi>Charilus</hi> pray'd her patience to hear him a few words.</p>

This he thought a proper Seaſon to diſcourſe him, of his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to <hi>Bellinda</hi> (whoſe Name we will preſerve tho' her Character's alter'd) he aſſur'd him of her fortune and his Intereſt with her, and that if he would pleaſe to afford him, the leaſt Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of his favour he did not queſtion Succeſs, and that he ſhould be not only able to repair the Breaches in his Eſtate, but conſiderably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it by this plentifull Addition. His Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle told him he had in ſo high a Meaſure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his Eſteem with him, that he might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagine he ſuffer'd as much in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others; That this would be a work of great difficulty, and beſide fortunes now a days were grown ſo common and Cunning, that very often the moſt Judicious Eye, could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the real from the Counterfeit. After other reaſonings on both ſides the Uncle ſeem'd to be ſatisfied with <hi>Charilus</hi> his diſcourſe of the fortune, and told him that if he would ſtay with him till Term which was not long, he would conſider farther of it, and then he had buisneſs at <hi>London.</hi> During his ſtay in the Country, he wrote two Letters to <hi>Bellinda,</hi> which he Show'd

               <p>A Gentleman who had been formerly a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and acquir'd a conſiderable Eſtate, withdrew into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, having Spent his younger years in the Noiſe and hurry of Buſineſs, reſolved now to enjoy the fruits of his Labours in quiet, and Gratifie himſelf with Solitude and Retirement; having a fair Houſe in <hi>Hartfordſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that he might not be out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of buſineſs in the world like an idle perſon, he ſtill kept ſome Ventures a broad, which he called the poors Stock, in which and all other his endeavours, providence bleſt his Induſtry with that conſtant fucceſs, that he uſed famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51968:52"/>to ſay he grew Rich in ſpight of his Teeth, for if he ſhut Money out at the door, it would come in at the Window. This Gentleman at his death left only one Child a Daughter call'd <hi>Joanna,</hi> to whom he gave a very great Fortune, and committed the care of her Perſon and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of her Eſtate to two Gentlemen her Guardians. She was now about Eight years old when ſhe deſir'd ſhe might (as ſhe uſually did once a year) go ſee her Uncle, a Gentleman of fair Reputation and good Eſtate in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which they granted, and ſent her over attended with two Servants. After ſhe had been there a Month, her Uncle who was a paſſionate Man, catching her in ſome fault threatned to whip her; She farther provoking him with ſome Scurvy reply, he did ſo, at which time as ſhe cryed out, was heard to ſay by ſome of the Neighbours, <hi>O pray <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle don't kill Me,</hi> which neither he or any of the Family took much No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at that time. The next Morning early ſhe ſtole out of the Houſe, and after ſhe had wander'd ſome Hours not knowing whether to go, met with a Company of <hi>Gipſies</hi> who took her up, made much of her, changing her Cloths and ſtaining her Complexion, brought her with them in few dayes to <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>don,</hi> and from thence went their Rounds into <hi>Hampſhire,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51968:52"/>Wiltſhire,</hi> and about the Country. The Uncle miſſing his Neece next day, made all poſſible Enquiry after her, ſent to all the Neighbouring Viliages, ſearch'd all the publick Roads, but could not receive any account of her. He next ſent into <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> to her Guardians to know if ſhe was return'd home, but meeting with no ſatisfaction, concluded that ſome young Gentleman who knew ſhe would be a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had Stole her, and carried her far away to ſome diſtant County where ſhe lay conceal'd. This the Guardians believed too, till ſome of the Neighbors at their Goſſipping, were prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what they heard others ſay, and began to wiſh ſeriouſly that it was not too true, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they conſider'd that if the Child dye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in her Minority, the whole Eſtate would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the Uncle. This was buzz'd about till at laſt it reach'd the Guardians Ears, who making more particular enquiry into the truth of it, were inform'd by ſome of the Neighbours that the Night before the Child was miſſing, they heard her cry out moſt lamentably, <hi>pray <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle don't kill Me,</hi> this they conſidered as an odd Circumſtance to happen juſt the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and asked the Perſons who thus informed, if they could ſafely take their Oaths of it, and would do ſo before a Magiſtrate, who ſaid, yes,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51968:53"/>it was all true and nothing but the truth. After ſome deliberation they acquainted the Uncle what the Neighbours ſaid, and how nearly it did touch his Reputation now, and might his Life hereafter, if his Neece was not found. He told them he was altogether innocent of any Injury done to her, nor did he remember that ever ſhe ſaid ſo, tho' he own'd he whipt her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, which was for telling a notorious Lye, and uſing ſome other indecent expreſſions, which he thought ſhe deſerved to be Corrected for. Upon this all the ponds and Rivers were ſearch'd, and a conſiderable reward promiſ'd to any Perſon, who could give an account of her alive or dead. No News being heard of her, the Neighbours began to Grumble and ſaid, that the Guardians and Uncle had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted to Murder the Child and Share her Eſtate: This being now grown a publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the Country to the great diſadvantage of their Reputation, who before were Eſteem'd as Gentlemen of Honour and integrity; They reſolved to probe the bottom of this cauſe, and proſecute the Uncle as far as the Law directed them. Accordingly they went over into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſent for him to a Gentlemans Houſe who was his Neighbour, and a Juſtice of the peace. Being altogether, the Guardians complain'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51968:53"/>to the Juſtice of this report, and deſir'd him that he would take Cognizance of it as far as the Law required, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poſſible their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Gentlemans might be preſerved free from ſuch an undeſerved calumny. The Juſtice ſent for the witneſſes, who Swore poſitively that on ſuch a Night, which was the immediate Night before ſhe was miſſing, they heard her cry out with a lamentable voice, <hi>pray <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle don't kill Me.</hi> Upon which the Juſtice bound the Uncle in a Recognizance of two Thouſand pounds to appear at the next Aſſize, and the Guardians in a bond of five Hundred to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Uncle. In this Interval the Uncle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſed all the probable means for a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that humane Wit could imagine, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make any, began to think what was to be done, the time of the Aſſize drew on, and then he ſhould certainly be Indicted for the Murder of <hi>Joanna,</hi> nor had he any way to clear his Innocence againſt ſuch Circumſtantial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but by a down-right Negation, which though ſome of his Friends might Credit, would yet take no place in a Court of Judicature. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus confidered the difficulty of his Caſe, he at laſt reſolved thus. In his ſearch after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna,</hi> he had found a poor Mans Daughter in another County, who both in Age, Features,

A day or two before the Aſſize, he gave out he had by great fortune found his Neece, brings her home to his Houſe with her real Father and Mother, who gave a Satisfactory account to all perſons how acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently they found her in a wood almoſt Starv'd, and She not remembring from whence She had wandred they Entertained her amongſt their own Children. The Girl own'd how ſhe Stole away for fear her Uncle ſhould whip her again as he threatned, all which Romance hung ſo well together, that the Guardians believ'd her the ſame, and no body queſtion'd the truth.

Yes, my Lord,</hi> ſaid the Guardians, After a farther account how ſhe was found the Judge order'd their Recognizance ſhould be withdrawn, and the Uncle diſcharged. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that an old Woman who was in Court about other buſineſs, hearing what a Buſtle had been made about her young Miſtreſs, and that ſhe was found again, as they came out of Court crowded to ſee her, and looking full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, believed it to be the ſame, but the Girl not taking Notice of her, She cryed out, <hi>O Miſtreſs you don't know Me,</hi> upon which She anſwer'd preſently, no, what ſayes she don't you know old Nurſe? I am ſure you are not the ſame then, upon this the Girl was ſtartled, the Guardians made a ſtop and asked her how ſhe came to forget Nurſe ſo ſoon, ſhe not give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preſent anſwer, they began to ſuſpect ſomething and brought her again into Court and Nurſe with her.</p>
               <p>The old Woman ſaid, <hi>She did believe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51968:55"/>it had been the ſame at firſt, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view ſhe much queſtion'd it, that ſhe her ſelf had Nurſt her till ſhe was almoſt four years old, and if it was her Miſtreſs ſhe had a Scar upon her left Arm above the Elbow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judge ordered they ſhould look upon her Arm, which they did, and reported there was no Scar above but one below the Elbow, upon this it was generally believ'd ſhe was the ſame, and all things ſet right again. However the Judge ſeem'd more diſatisfied then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ordered the Uncle to withdraw, and examined the Girl, Afterwards the Man apart, who ſaid he had found her in a Wood, and then the woman, and here he found they all diſagreed in one point or other, at length by croſsing the account of the Man and Wife, and then conſidering that both the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Nurſe agreed the true <hi>Joanna,</hi> muſt needs have remembred her Nurſe, ſince it was not a Twelve-Month ago ſince ſhe ſaw and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly knew her, they agreed it was yet a Cheat, which the Woman for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firſt Confeſt, and then her husband own'd it, and laſtly the Girl; They proved the Receit of ſo much Money at ſuch a time, proved by ſeveral neighbours, who had known this Girl
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51968:55"/>for five or ſix years together, that ſhe alwayes was look'd upon and reputed as their own Child and alwayes liv'd with them. Upon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery an Indictment was preferr'd againſt the Uncle, for the Murder of his Neece <hi>Joanna,</hi> but he having no proof to clear himſelf by, and this appearing with ſo foul a Face againſt him, he was Condemn'd to be hang'd, and was within a Week after Executed. It fortuned about nine years after at the Summer Aſſize at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> two young Gentlemen who were lately call'd to the Bar, whereof the Judges Son was one, walking out early one Morning in the fields they ſaw a whole Covie of Gipſies under a Hedge, when they came near, two of them ſtept out, and in their Cant told them a great deal of good fortune by looking into their Hands, and viewing the lines of the Face as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, upon which one Gentleman threw them a Shilling, the other call'd them idle Whores, and ſaid they deſerv'd to be whipt for publick Cheats, upon which one of them a tall black Girl told him, he ought not to deſpiſe a Gipſie for he ſhould Marry one before he was Three Months older, at this the Gentlemen fell a laughing and entertain'd them with other like diſcourſe; when they came home one of them miſt his gold Watch, and another had loſt all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51968:56"/>his Money. They began to grow angry to be thus Cheated, and getting a Conſtable very luckily, met with theſe two going off another way; They charg'd them with the Watch and Money, which they as peremptorily denyed, upon which the Conſtable brought them along into open Court which was then ſitting, upon Examination they denyed the Fact, nor could they upon ſearch find either about them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Judge ordered them to be ſoundly laſh'd for Vagrants, and ſent out of Town, as the Conſtable was taking them away, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who was the Judges Son, call'd out Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſely to the Conſtable, pray favour the black-woman, for ſhe tells me, I ſhall Marry a Gipſie within theſe three Months; which his Father overhearing call'd them back again, and ask'd them</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How long they had pretended to telling of Fortunes, I had thought,</hi> ſayes the Judge, <hi>all your Trade had been Picking of Pockets; No,</hi> and pleaſe you my Lord ſayes the black-Woman, <hi>my profeſſion is only tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Fortunes, I never underſtood nor practiſed ſuch unlawfull Arts,</hi> at which the Court laugh'd — My Lord then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51968:56"/>ask'd (ſeeing her a good favour'd young Woman, and ſo quick in her Anſwers) <hi>what Country Woman ſhe was,</hi> to which ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe thought</hi> Hartfordſhire. Then he askt, <hi>if ſhe was born a Gipſy;</hi> She ſaid <hi>No, but She was as good, for She had been Nine years Apprentice to a Gipſy.</hi> At which he ask'd her, <hi>if ſhe had e're a Chriſtian Name, yes, my Lord,</hi> ſayes ſhe, <hi>I think ſo, for my Name is</hi> Joanna, the Judge hearing the Name <hi>Joanna</hi> recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected himſelf, and remembred the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Gentleman, who was by him Condemn'd for Murdering his Neece of that Name. He then asked her, <hi>if ſhe had ever been in</hi> Eſſex, <hi>or had any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations there;</hi> She ſaid, <hi>not ſince ſhe was very Young, which was at the time ſhe met with the Gipſys firſt, and then She had an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle there, who uſed her very hardly, and ſo ſhe ran away from him, and was never there ſince, nor never Enquired after him.</hi> Upon this he concluded her to be the ſame Perſon, and call'd to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51968:57"/>and told him, he ſhould not let them be whipt, but carry them home to his own Houſe and Entertain them there, till the Court was up, and then he ſhould receive farther Orders. The whole Court at this began to Wonder, and believe one or both of them to be Gentlewomen of good Families, nor did they ſpare telling the young Gentleman <hi>that for ought they knew it might be his Fortune indeed to Marry a Gipſy, if this Young Woman ſhould prove to be a Perſon of Quality and Eſtate,</hi> which fell out even ſo, for the Aſſizes being over, the Judge who had a Seat in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> and had known her Father formerly, brought her up in his Coach, and preſented her to the Guardians who own'd her to be the ſame Perſon, which the Nurſe and all her Surviving Relations Confirm'd. At the ſame time his Lordſhip, who knew her to be a very great Fortune, propoſ'd a Match between his Son and her which ſhe Franckly conſented to,

               <p>The <hi>Count de Montallo</hi> who was Ambaſſadour from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the Engliſh Court, being ſhortly to return, and having often admired the Beautifull <hi>Orithia,</hi> as the moſt lovely Creature his Eyes yet beheld, made his private Addreſſes to her, and without the knowledge or Conſent of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations was Married to her.</p>

After her Arrival at <hi>Savoy,</hi> for three years ſhe liv'd as happy &amp; as great as heart could wiſh, the Count her Husband lov'd her above all the World, and his Eſtate, which was very conſiderable, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at her Command.

The Duke being now with his Army, and not expected back till a peace was concluded, which was yet but uncertainly diſcourſ'd; <hi>Sabrino,</hi> who had the largeſt Commiſſion of any of the reſt, and much more reſpected, conſidered that this was the only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity his heart could wiſh for, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat thoſe deſires he had ſo long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51968:60"/>ſome Urgent buſineſs, he found her alone in her Cloſet, where without any regard to the Honour of the Count, the Vertue of the Lady, which he had no reaſon to ſuſpect, or to the Modeſty and good manners in himſelf, of which he ought to have had ſome ſhare, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his unlawfull paſſion, which ſhe received with that abhorrence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation that he was well aſſured he was now undone for ever if he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf by being the firſt Accuſer, tho' he had nothing to Charge the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Orithia</hi> with, but what was falſe as Hell or Devils could invent. However envenom'd malice will want neither Inſtruments or Methods to perfect its Revenge; tho' what wrong had <hi>Sabrino</hi> received? He firſt gives the affront, and then demands Satisfaction, and firſt Tempts the Lady with his laſcivious addreſs, then calls himſelf injur'd, ſo great a Crime is it to be good and Vertuous in the proſpect of thoſe who
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51968:61"/>are wicked and debauch'd. <hi>Sabrino,</hi> that he might loſe no opportunity, ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the three Commiſſioners to meet him at his own Chamber, where he told them,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He had a ſecret of that importance to communicate to them and of that ſtrange Surprize, that he wanted words to expreſs the preſent Horrour of his thoughts; I have for ſome time ſuſpected, and I wiſh I could ſay I did yet but ſuſpect, Oh ſhall I ſpeak it! The Fidelity and Chaſtity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi>— upon which one of them told him, Sir, I will as ſoon believe, the Glorious Cherubins may be tainted in their pure Angelic Natures, as that any Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſhoneſty hath or ever ſhall aſſoil the Vertue of that immaculate Lady. <hi>Oh Sir, ſayes</hi> Sabrino, <hi>be not too forward I once thought ſo too, but I am afraid I ſhall be able to convince you ſooner then you or I could wiſh for. In the Interim pray make your own Obſervations, and let this paſs no farther.</hi>

                  <hi>Sabrino</hi> had a Nephew a proper young Gentleman, who had been Page to the <hi>Count</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſince his return, was prefer'd to be Gentleman Uſher to the Counteſs; This Gentleman he ſent for privately to his Chamber, and told him he underſtood what a particular kindneſs the Counteſs had for him, and that now was the time for him to make his fortunes in the abſence of his Lord The young Gentleman told him, he did not underſtand his meaning, O Nephew ſaid he, are you ſo ſhort ſighted, why the Counteſs is in love with you above all the World, and wants nothing but an opportunity, to compleat yours and her own happineſs in Bed, which I have promiſed her this Night. Wherefore you muſt in the Evening pretend to go Sick to Bed, and then undreſs to your Gown, and Steal into the Counteſs's Chamber, and lye under the Bed, till ſhe gives you Notice to come forth, but be ſure no Body ſees you enter her
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51968:62"/>Chamber, if they do, make ſome excuſe and go out again and ſo wait till you have an opportunity, pray Uncle, ſayes the young Gentleman, did the Counteſs her ſelf bid you tell me thus? I, I, She her ſelf bid me, and ſaid, that very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhe would make you Gentleman of the Horſe. The innocent Gentleman diſcovered not the Snares his Uncle had laid for him but in the Evening accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did ſo, after <hi>Sabrino</hi> had been at his Chamber and found him not there nor about the Houſe, he concluded he was then ſafely Lodg'd under the Bed, and a little before the Counteſs went to her Chamber, ſent for the Commiſſioners, and told them, <hi>he was inform'd that the Counteſs's Gallant was to be with her that Night, but who he was that he could not tell, Sabrino</hi> and the reſt concluded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome extraordinary buſineſs, to be diſpatched that Night and to deſire to ſpeak with her as ſoon as her Women had left her, and then if there was any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51968:62"/>Gallant, they ſhould certainly diſcover him, if not give the Counteſs no reaſon to ſuſpect their deſign, Accordingly they did ſo, and coming ſoftly up ſtairs knock'd at her Chamber door, an old Gentlewoman who had formerly been her Nurſe, lay in the Chamber with her, and was going into Bed, when ſhe heard ſome Body knock at the Chamber door, She asked who was there? And their buſineſs, to which one of them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, we are the Commiſſioners and want to ſpeak one word with her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon Urgent buſineſs, which was forgot before, and muſt be diſpatched this Night. She acquainted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs with what they ſaid, who ordered her to let them in. As they were by her Bed-ſide diſcourſing with her, <hi>Sabrino</hi> cryes out, <hi>I, here he is, here's the Rogue, and pulls his Nephew by the heels from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed, and calling him Rogue, Villain and Traytor to abuſe ſe good a Lord,</hi> ſtruck him through the heart with his Sword,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51968:63"/>before he could ſpeak one word to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf or his Ladies Honour. It was now in vain for the Counteſs to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to purge her ſelf from a Crime which appeared againſt her by ſo Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Evidence, tho' ſhe did in the preſence of ſeveral Worthy perſons take the Sacrament upon it, that as ſhe never had been Guilty againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Bed, ſo ſhe knew nothing of that Perſons being there; that it was all the malicious Contrivance of <hi>Sabrino</hi> (whoſe unlawful deſires ſhe had refuſed with Scorn and contempt) that had now plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Revenge to Rob her of her life and Honour at the ſame time. This ſome believ'd, who thought the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs to be as uncorrupt as Vertue it ſelf. But others ſaid here's plain demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt her, and ſhe who dares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, will not ſtick to a lye to defend her Guilt. The Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners writ a Letter to the Count to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with this unhappy News, in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51968:63"/>which they gave a moſt particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and in the Cloſe highly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Fidelity and Juſtice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brino,</hi> who ſeeing his Honour abuſed, would not ſpare his neareſt Relation. The Count was aſtoniſhed at the News above any Misfortune that could have happened, and notwithſtanding this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, as they call'd it in their Letter, he put a greater Confidence in the Juſtice and integrity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, then in all their Solemn proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as he ſent them word</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was extreamly troubled for the Counteſs that ſhe ſhould lye under ſo heavy an Aſperſion, which if he did not believe the World would, and therefore with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for her deliverance (if Innocent) did reſign her up to the Law, ſo he ſhould have been much better Satisfied in the Guilt of his Wife, if</hi> Sabrino <hi>had Spar'd his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Life, in that Tranſport of rage in which he kill'd him.</hi>

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:51968:64"/>Commiſſioners, (as the Cuſtom is there) diſpoſed the Counteſs into a Nunnery, where She is to continue a year and a day, and if in that time no Champion appears to juſtifie her Innocence againſt her Accuſer, She is upon the laſt day brought into the Liſt appointed for the Combatants (if there be any) and there burnt at a Stake, which death ſhe Legally ſuffers if her Champion has the worſt of it. The Counteſs was highly ſenſible of this as the greateſt affliction that ever befell her, yet her own Innocence, and the Satisfaction that aroſe from thence made the diſtreſs much more eaſy and ſupportable. The Count was ſtill En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Wars, and the Counteſs had now been three quarters of a year a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Nunnery, and no Perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in her behalf to Vindicate her Honour and Virtue. She now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſmall remainder of her Life would ſoon be gone, and unleſs ſome Centleman would Entertain ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51968:64"/>thoughts of her, as to believe her Guiltleſs, and Engage his Life to preſerve hers, ſhe muſt certainly ſuffer, and as no Perſon had yet offer'd himſelf, ſo was ſhe altogether at a loſs where to find that Gallant Friend. At laſt amongſt other Engliſh Gentlemen who had been formerly her Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, She fixt upon <hi>Philanthus,</hi> but at the ſame time Corrected her Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in thinking that he who believed himſelf the moſt diſobliged of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould now hazard his Life to Vindicate her Reputation, No, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would be pleaſ'd to hear of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and rejoyce to ſee her proud heart now humbled under the deepeſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but on the other Hand conſidering him as a Gentleman, a Perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Courage and Gallantry, and one whoſe former affections were moſt ſincerely devoted to her Service, he would rather Court ſuch an opportunity to lay an everlaſting obligation on her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51968:65"/>which all her Treaſury of thanks and Gratitude ſhould be too poor to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. And this took place in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; Accordingly She writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Philanthus</hi> and ſent it by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been formerly her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, with orders where to find or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for him at <hi>London,</hi> and to deliver him that Letter, receive his Anſwer and return with all ſpeed. <hi>Philanthus</hi> who had ſtill the ſame reſpect and love for <hi>Orithia</hi> as would conſiſt with Honour, having read the Letter, was extreamly troubled at it, but at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruin'd himſelf in his Fortunes, his mind ſunk under the load of miſeries which oppreſt him, writ back a moſt paſſionate Letter of excuſe, with which ſhe was no leſs affected as well for his as her own ſake. <hi>Orithia</hi> Spent her ſhort time (which now wanted but a week of the fatal day) in recommending her Soul to Heaven, wholly deſpairing of any relief on Earth. <hi>Philanthus</hi> having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51968:65"/>ſince ſeriouſly conſidered the preſent diſtreſs of the Counteſs, and that ſhe muſt for ever ſuffer in her Memory, which to all Noble Spirits is Ten times worſe then a Thouſand deaths, and that though in his excuſe to her he had not put his own intereſt or buſineſs into the Scale to ballance againſt her Life and Honour; But that ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected diſaſters had reduced him to that mean degree of want that he was not able to Equip himſelf for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Yet this from a Generous Spirit was mean and pitifull, that however his Friends would not aſſiſt him here, he could want nothing there of Horſe or Arms a <hi>Cavalier</hi> could ask. After he had ponder'd a while on this thought he went to a Gentleman of his intimate acquaintance, ſhow'd him the Letter, and beg'd of him to furniſh him with Moneys for that deſign which he did, and <hi>Philan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51968:66"/>Weeds, he would walk over that Afternoon and return in the Evening, and leave his Horſe and Armour there till he came back,</hi> the Hermit very readily agreed to it, then <hi>Philanthus</hi> who ſpoke <hi>Italian</hi> well, put on his Weeds, and in all Reſpects appear'd to be a grave Religious Hermit, having a long Beard and all things anſwerable, He was now Arriv'd at the Nunnery, and out of Reſpect to his habit (for Hermits are there had in great Veneration) was immediately conducted into the Counteſſes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where entring, thoſe Nunns who were attending upon her withdrew, that ſhe might have the more freedom of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with this Religious Father. He ſtayed with her three Hours, and was as well ſatisfi'd of her Innocency and <hi>Sabrino's</hi> Roguery as his heart could wiſh. Asking her, <hi>if ſhe had no hopes of any Friend to appear in the Liſts to Morrow on her behalf,</hi> She ſaid, <hi>No, She never ſent but to One Engliſh Gentleman, and his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51968:67"/>happen'd at the ſame time to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as great as her own.</hi> When he took his leave of the Counteſs, ſhe pull'd off a Diamond Ring from her Finger, and told him, <hi>Holy Father, I am oblig'd to you above what I am able to Expreſs for your Prayers, and good Advice, I have nothing of Worldly Goods-left Me to diſpoſe of but this Ring, which was given Me by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in</hi> England, <hi>a little before I Married into this Country, I pray accept it, and keep it for my ſake.</hi> The Hermit receiv'd it with all Thankfulneſs, and taking his leave, burſt out into tears to ſee ſo great a Beauty reduc'd to thoſe thin meagre looks, and that Vertue of which ſhe had ſo large a portion ſhould be Triumph'd over by wickedneſs and Villainy. At parting the Counteſs ſhook him by the Hand and chearfully bid him not weep, this was the laſt day ſhe could be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Philanthus</hi> return'd to the Cell where he again put on his own Habit, and told the Hermit what he thought of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51968:67"/>the Innocency of the Counteſs. The next Morning at Nine of the Clock the Counteſs all in white, was brought from the Nunnery into a fair adjacent plain, in the middle of which was ſixt a Stake, with a great deal of dryed Wood and other Combuſtible Matter. On a large Scaffold on one ſide was a Chair plac'd for the Counteſs, and at the other end a Tribunal Erected for thoſe who were appointed to ſee the Execution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and if there ſhould happen to be any Combatants, to determine any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of difference that ſhould ariſe. The Judges being Seated on the Tribunal and the Counteſs in the Chair, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made, <hi>that if any Perſon would Venture to Wage War in defence of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi> de Montallo's <hi>Innocency,</hi> Seignior Sabrino the Accuſer <hi>was ready to Anſwer him at ſingle Combat.</hi> Before this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made, all the Drums, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Clarions and Inſtruments of field Muſick firſt ſounded, &amp; then the principal
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51968:68"/>of the Judges gave order for the firſt Proclamation, and ſo for the Second, when being ready to give the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, at a diſtance appear'd a Champion who by the waving of his Sword, gave Notice what he intended, he was Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Milk white Courſer in black Mourning Armour, his Beaver faſt lock't down, his Device, the Sun Shining glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly from a Cloud upon diſtreſſed Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which was a Virgin habited all in white. As ſoon as this ſtrange Champion was Enter'd the Liſts, a Herald demanded of him <hi>who he was that came thus Arm'd?</hi> he told him, <hi>he came to loſo his Life or Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Honour of the Counteſs of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallo, <hi>who was unjuſtly accuſ'd by a Rogue a Lyar and a Vilain; and that he would prove him to be.</hi> Upon this the Herald demanded of the Counteſs, <hi>if ſhe was willing to Venture her Life and Honour upon the Succeſs of her Champion,</hi> to which ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>yes, I pray God proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per him.</hi> Immediately after upon the
